VarImpact TODOs

Alan priorities:
- Make more scalable (multinode clustering, better parallelization).
- Add CV-TMLE

Chris items:
* Arguments
  - Also support "X" optional argument, ala glm
  - Pass in cluster argument, ala mcSuperLearner / snowSuperLearner
  - Parameter for the number of covariates after which we use dimensionality reduction (HOPACH).
  - Argument for p-value cutoff for consistent results.
* Coding style
  - Create subfunctions.
* Output
  - Support summary()
* Quality
  - Figure out how to reduce the number of potential failures in various steps.
* Testing
  - Add tests
* Performance
  - Benchmark to random forest and related VIM algorithms.
  - Compare to RF-style perturbation VIM but with SL?

From existing documentation:
- Making options to avoid errors include putting minimum cell size on validation sample of A vs. Y
- Implementing CV-TMLE (minCell)
- Making examples
- References
- See also's
- Allow reporting of results that randomly do not have estimates for some of validation samples.


Wishlist
- Support clustering or variable reduction algorithms other than HOPACH.
