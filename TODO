VarImpact TODOs

Alan priorities:
- Add CV-TMLE

Chris items:
* Arguments
  - Also support "X" optional argument, ala glm
  - Parameter for the number of covariates after which we use dimensionality reduction (HOPACH).
  - Argument for p-value cutoff for consistent results.
* Coding style
  - Create subfunctions.
* Output
  - Support summary()
* Quality
  - Figure out how to reduce the number of potential failures in various steps.
* Testing
  - Add other tests.
* Performance
  - Benchmark to random forest, lasso, OLS and SL-perturbation algorithms.
* Examples
  - Simulated dataset
  - mlbench dataset
* CRAN
  - Fix warnings and errors generated by package checking.
* BUGS
  - In cor(na.omit(cbind(x, y))) : the standard deviation is zero
  - In is.na(object) : is.na() applied to non-(list or vector) of type 'NULL'

From existing documentation:
- Implementing CV-TMLE
- Allow reporting of results that randomly do not have estimates for some of validation samples.

Wishlist
- Support clustering or variable reduction algorithms other than HOPACH.
