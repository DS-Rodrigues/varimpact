VarImpact TODOs

Alan priorities:
- Add CV-TMLE
- Unadjusted difference in means estimate (t-test) to compare to TMLE estimate
- Cell sizes in the groups that it chooses (A = 0 and A = 1)
- Option of ratios (delta method), rather than differences
   - Alan will email Minh, maybe Jeremy too. (may be embedded in TMLE)
- In ByV table, use the labels of the quantiles to show the actual range.

Chris items:
* Arguments
  - Also support "X" optional argument, ala glm
  - Parameter for the number of covariates after which we use dimensionality reduction (HOPACH).
  - Argument for p-value cutoff for consistent results.
* Coding style
  - Create subfunctions.
* Output
  - Support summary()
* Quality
  - Figure out how to reduce the number of potential failures in various steps.
* Testing
  - Add other tests.
* Performance
  - Try Rprofvis
  - Use Jeremy's method of not wasting SL folds during CV-TMLE.
* Benchmarking
  - Benchmark to random forest, lasso, OLS and SL-perturbation algorithms.
* CRAN
  - Fix warnings and errors generated by package checking.
* BUGS
  - In cor(na.omit(cbind(x, y))) : the standard deviation is zero

From existing documentation:
- Implementing CV-TMLE
- Allow reporting of results that randomly do not have estimates for some of validation samples.

Wishlist
- Support clustering or variable reduction algorithms other than HOPACH.
